// 3756. Concatenate Non-Zero Digits and Multiply by Sum II
// You are given a string s of length m consisting of digits. You are also given a 2D integer array queries, where queries[i] = [li, ri].

// For each queries[i], extract the substring s[li..ri]. Then, perform the following:

// Form a new integer x by concatenating all the non-zero digits from the substring in their original order. If there are no non-zero digits, x = 0.
// Let sum be the sum of digits in x. The answer is x * sum.
// Return an array of integers answer where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.

// Since the answers may be very large, return them modulo 109 + 7.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: s = "10203004", queries = [[0,7],[1,3],[4,6]]

// Output: [12340, 4, 9]
